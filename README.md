If I had to describe myself in one line, I would say that I'm a versatile analyst with experience in data wrangling, automating data pipelines, and developing
machine learning models with emphasis on communicating results to stakeholders.
I have always enjoyed solving problems using Python and love learning about the recent advancements in the space of Machine Learning.

My primary skillset includes Python, SQL, R, and Tableau. I have completed multiple internships that focused on data science and software engineering during my time as an undergrad student in Mumbai, India. I worked at <a href='https://www.mygreatlearning.com'>Great Learning</a> as an Associate Data Scientist, where I built and maintained dashboards focused on learner attrition in the International Operations Department.

I have also passed 3 certifications in the past 6 months:
1. AWS Cloud Practitioner [Verification Link](https://www.credly.com/badges/46b1a055-b35f-4719-a3d8-043340660e95/public_url)
